# Statistical-analysis-on-COVID-19-data
A small survey on COVID-19 data
Back on july, 2020 I did a statistical analysis on the COVID-19 data using `R' statistical software
The data contains daily count of individuals (by country) tested for COVID-19, confirmed, recovered, dead,
hospitalized, forced to use ventilators, or ICU. There are other details such as country level population and
preventive measures (School closure, gathering restrictions etc.)
The repository contains three main files related to data (in a compressed file), R code and the final report of the analysis in a pdf.
